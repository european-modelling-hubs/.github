The European Modelling Hubs provide forecasts and scenario modelling outputs to governments, healthcare agencies, and the public. The ensemble model approach, where results from multiple contributed models are pooled together, is used to account for the uncertainty arising from the different ways a given phenomenon can be modelled. The hubs follow an open science approach where modellers openly share their code and assumptions to increase the likelihood of modelling outputs being adopted, as well as facilitating progress in modelling techniques. This initiative is led by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Currently active hubs are [RespiCast](https://respicast.ecdc.europa.eu/) (the European respiratory diseases forecasting hub) & [RespiCompass](https://respicompass.ecdc.europa.eu/) (the European respiratory diseases scenario modelling hub)
